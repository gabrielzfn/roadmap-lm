# ROADMAP-LM

### 🧭 Legal Metrology Software Evaluation Roadmap

This repository provides a roadmap for software evaluation within the scope of legal metrology, based on an understanding of normative studies, technical interpretations, and practical methodologies for compliance assessment.

<br>

### 📘 Overview

The roadmap was created to guide professionals, researchers, and regulatory bodies in the evaluation of software used in measuring instruments and metrological systems. It compiles structured knowledge from international and national standards, aligning with best practices for software conformity assessment.

<br>

### 🎯 Objectives

- Define a structured approach for software evaluation in legal metrology.
- Support the interpretation of normative documents and metrological requirements.
- Establish a baseline for conformity testing and documentation review.
- Promote consistency and transparency in metrological software assessments.

<br>

### 🧩 Scope

This roadmap applies to:

- Measuring instruments incorporating embedded or external software.
- Evaluation processes defined under legal metrology regulations.
- Studies of traceability, sealing, and data integrity in metrological systems.

It does not aim to replace specific standards or technical guides, but to complement them with interpretive and procedural insights.

<br>

### 🧰 Tools Directory

This repository also includes a dedicated directory containing tools that may be useful during software analysis, testing, or documentation review. These tools should be introduced gradually over time. Therefore, please be patient.
